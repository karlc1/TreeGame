# TreeGame

This is an attempt at game development in pure golang. The goal is to not use any game engine or development tools aside from a a bare-bone physics library and a renderer.  
For physics, I use [ByteArenas golang port of Box2D](https://github.com/ByteArena/box2d), and for drawing graphics I use [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go).
