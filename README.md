# TreeGame

This is an attempt at game development in pure golang. The goal is to not use any game engine or development tools (like unity etc) aside from a a bare-bone physics library and a renderer.  
For physics, I use [ByteArenas golang port of Box2D](https://github.com/ByteArena/box2d), and for drawing graphics I use [faiface's pixel lib](https://github.com/faiface/pixel).
